# Harvardx Data Science Professional Certificate


This repository includes my course notes, assessments, and resources from [*Module 3: Probability*](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-probability) of the 17-month-long [Harvardx Professional Certificate Program in Data Science](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science).

## Module 3: Data Science - Probability

### What I Learned:

#### **Section 1:	Discrete Probability:**
- Important concepts in probability theory including random variables and independence
- The meaning of expected values and standard errors and how to compute them in R
- Applied basic probability theory to categorical data
- Performed Monte Carlo simulations to approximate the results of repeating an experiment over and over, including simulating the outcomes in the Monty Hall problem
- Distinguished between: sampling with and without replacement, events that are and are not independent, and combinations and permutations
- Applied the multiplication and addition rules, as appropriate, to calculate the probably of multiple events occurring
- Used sapply instead of a for loop to perform element-wise operations on a function

#### **Section 2:	Continuous Probability**
- Understoodd the differences between calculating probabilities for discrete and continuous data
- Used cumulative distribution functions to assign probabilities to intervals when dealing with continuous data
- Used R to generate normally distributed outcomes for use in Monte Carlo simulations
- Knew some useful theoretical continuous distributions such as normal, student-t, chi-squared, exponential, gamma, beta & beta-binomial distributions

#### **Section 3:	Random Variables, Sampling Models & Central Limit Theorem**
- Understood what random variables are, how to generate them, and the correct mathematical notation to use with them
- Used sampling models to estimate characteristics of a larger population
- Explained the difference between a distribution and a probability distribution
- Understood the Central Limit Theorem, its importance, and and the law of large numbers

#### **Section 4:	The Big Short:** Case Study
- Understood the relationship between sampling models and interest rates (as determined by banks)
- Understood how interest rates can be set to minimize the chances of the bank losing money
- Understood how inappropriate assumptions of independence contributed to the financial meltdown of 2007
